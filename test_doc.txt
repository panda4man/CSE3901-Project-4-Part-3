Description: This document contains information on calculator designed and developed for part 3 of project 4.
================

DESCRIPTION: This project involved the design and development of a calculator web application. The features of the calculator include the following: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents and square root.

STRUCTURE: The html for this project was created by Andrew Clinton. The markup consists of divs and tables creating a simple grid structure.

STYLE: The css style sheet that houses all of the styling was created by Andrew Clinton. Styling was partially inspired by the basic Android calculator.

LOGIC: The javascript that implements all of the interactivity for the calculator is broken up into three files:

	index.js (Andrew Clinton)- This file was houses much of the logic behind the clickable buttons on the calculator.

	bst.js (Don Herre)- This file uses JavaScript prototyping and a binary search tree structure that forms expression trees that can be solved with recursion. 

	keyboard.js (Don Herre)- This file interprets keyboard input to add ease of use. This feature is somewhat experimental. Some features remained slightly buggy depending on the system and browser used.

TESTING: 

	To test the calculator and eliminate bugs in the code various expressions were input into the calculator and compared with output from known working calculators.
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| INPUT                | OUTPUT              | REASON                                        |  
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| -436/44*7+77-2*3     | 1.6363636363636402  | leading negative, multiple order of operations|
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| 562^2^2+2-6*9/4-3    | 99757432321.5       | multiple exponential operations               |
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	| sqrt(999)            | 31.606961258558215  | square root                                   |
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	| 99.3/0.6             | 165.5               | decimals                                      |
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| 5687-33287           | -27600              | negative result                               |
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Each of these results was verified.

	Testing was also done with each of the buttons to make sure of functionality. This includes making sure each individual button does what one would expect on a normal calculator.

CONCLUSION: The final product of this project is working calculator with most of the basic features of a typical calculator.
